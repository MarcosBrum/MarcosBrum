# Portfolio of Data Science Projects by Marcos Brum

Hi there ðŸ‘‹, welcome to my portfolio. Here you will find links to the Data Science projects I have been working on. The purpose of these projects is to demonstrate my skills in solving business problems using techniques and tools of Data Science.

## Marcos Brum

###### Data Scientist and Mathematical-Physicist

I have been studying Data Science since 2020. After a few months of dedicated study I started working on Data Analysis and Data Science projects to develop and demonstrate my skills. My present job is Lecturer of Calculus and Calculus for Biological Sciences at UFRJ (Campus Duque de Caxias).

I have experience in using the tools of Data Science to develop business solutions, from the understanding of the business problem to interpreting the model results in terms of business profit.

I have developed a project which predicts the amount of sales that will occur in the following six weeks at the stores of a large Drugstore chain in Europe. The details of the project are described below.

**Analytical Tools**:

**Data Collecting**: SQL, Postgres

**Data Processing and Analysis**: Python

**Development**: Git, Linux

**Machine Learning**: Classification, Reggression

The stores of the Rossmann drugstore chain need to be restored and the CEO needs to decide how much is going to be dedicated to the restoration of each one. To support this decision, the Analytics team is asked to present a sales forecast for each store during a period of six weeks, alongside with the total income expected in the chain. This forecast also informs the CEO which store is able to account for its own restoration with the income within this period.

The gross expected income of the majority of stores is in the range between R$5000.00 and R$22000.00. The chain is expected to obtain R$289,822,112.00, with best and worst case scenarios of R$290,808,412.17 and R$288,835,860.27, respectively. These scenarios are predicted using statistical errors (mean absolute percentage error).
